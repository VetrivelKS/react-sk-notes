remove webpack server and use backendjs to startexpress server
 
 context should be specified to use it in server (else it will give the local disk)
 
 if context is set
 
 __dirname will give "c://vetri/blah/balaj/reactWorkspace" where app.js is present (absolute path)
 
 
 
else
__dirname will give c:// alone

Object.assign({},common,serverConfig)
//(returnObj,obj1,obj2) = output will be obj1+obj2



EXPRESSJS is a middleware between request and response
\
npm install webpack -g

-g for global installation


frontend.js - from main.js
back -from app.js


two way - code will become unpredicatable
Uni directional (component to view)
flux-(view to component) dispatcher.js(hub for all actions)

npm install flux react-flux --save


react doesnt take care of state
so we have to do it
so only Redux


inside componentDidMount, addChangeListener
